# Filter field reference:
# - dx_call: DX callsign pattern (supports * wildcard for prefix/suffix)
# - spotter: Spotter callsign pattern (supports * wildcard)
# - bands: Array of bands ["160m", "80m", "40m", "30m", "20m", "17m", "15m", "12m", "10m", "6m"]
# - modes: Array of modes ["CW", "RTTY", "FT8", "FT4", "PSK31"]
# - spot_types: Array of types ["CQ", "BEACON", "NCDXF_BEACON"]
# - min_snr / max_snr: SNR range in dB
# - min_wpm / max_wpm: WPM range
